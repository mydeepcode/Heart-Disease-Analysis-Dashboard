### 🎯 5.1.2 Dashboard Goals

* Visualize **overall survival rate & total deaths**
* Identify **age-wise survival trends**
* Track **serum creatinine & ejection fraction impact** on survival
* Analyze **lifestyle and medical conditions** (smoking, diabetes, anaemia, high BP) across age groups
* Compare **male vs female survival patterns**

### 📊 5.1.3 Key Visuals

* **KPI Cards:** Survival Rate, Average Age, Total Deaths, Total Survivors
* **Bar + Line Combo Charts:** Survival Count vs Serum Creatinine, Survival Count vs Ejection Fraction
* **Area Chart:** Survival Rate by Age Group
* **Sankey/Flow Chart:** Impact of Smoking, BP, Anaemia & Diabetes by Age Group
